Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a command-line application designed to help freelance web developers quickly generate simple SVG logos for their projects. By prompting the user for text, colors, and shapes, the application dynamically generates a customizable logo and saves it as an SVG file. This eliminates the need to hire a graphic designer for basic logo creation, making it an efficient tool for developers who need quick and personalized branding for their projects.
